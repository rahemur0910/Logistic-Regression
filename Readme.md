Interpretation: Understanding the Output and Coefficients:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score: These metrics provide an overall evaluation of the model's performance. Higher values indicate better performance.
Confusion Matrix:
TP (True Positives): Correctly predicted readmissions.
TN (True Negatives): Correctly predicted non-readmissions.
FP (False Positives): Incorrectly predicted readmissions.
FN (False Negatives): Incorrectly predicted non-readmissions.
Coefficients and Intercept:
The coefficients indicate the weight of each feature in the prediction. Positive values increase the probability of readmission, while negative values decrease it.
The intercept is the model's bias term.

Conclusion:
The practical implementation of Logistic Regression using Scikit-Learn showcases how to prepare data, train a model, evaluate its performance, and interpret the results. Understanding these steps is crucial for applying Logistic Regression to real-world problems effectively.
